# ATM_simulation
Python Project: ATM Simulator
This code provides a simple ATM simulation experience. It first prompts the user to enter their pin. If the pin is incorrect, it displays an error message and exits. If the pin is correct, it enters a loop where the user can choose to check their balance, withdraw money, deposit money, or exit the simulation. The balance is updated accordingly based on the user's actions.
